I removed the sorting of the entire vector since std::nth_element partially sorts the vector, which puts the nth element in the correct position, but doesn't
 fully sort the vector. I also use std::nth_element to find the median element. As it directly finds the median elements For odd vectors, and finds the middle element
  and the one before it for even vectors, hence, allowing us to calculate the median.
