In the calculator I added negative numbers by regonizing the - before a number, remainder, variable assignment by inputing "let var = expression;" in the calculator,
 as well as storage for those variables. There's also symblolic values that are jsut predefined but well known, in this case "pi", and "e" and an enhanced error handling
 system that gives more information based on what error you produced. Then there is the Calculator on :) and Calculator off :( which just add more to the interface by letting
  you know for sure whether you're calculator is on or off. I have also added a menu by pressing m which tells you all the features and what they do
